TRIGGER 1 ( trigger_1.sql )


● This trigger is an insert trigger.
● When a new record is inserted into the PATIENT table, the trigger is executed
● When a new record is inserted into the Patient table, the following occurs:
○ A room in the ROOM table whose Status=’Empty’ is now changed to
Status=’Filled’ and this room is assigned to the new patient ie entered as a
record in ROOM_ASSIGNMENTS table (hence a filled room is not
assigned to the new patient and only a previously empty room is assigned)
○ A nurse who was not assigned to any patient, is assigned to the new patient.
This is entered as a record in NURSE_PATIENT_ASSIGNMENT
○ A cleaner is selected at random, and is assigned to clean the room assigned
to the new patient. This is entered as a record in the
CLEANER_ROOM_ASSIGNMENT table


TRIGGER 2  ( trigger_2.sql )


● This trigger is an update trigger
● When a patient is leaving the nursing home, the corresponding record in the
PATIENT table is updated, to set the Date_out as the current date. (ie if the elderly
patient leaves the patient on 27th of March 2020, the corresponding record is
updated to set Date_out=’2020-03-27’ )
● When a patient record in PATIENT is updated to set Date_out=’today’ , the
following occurs:
● After the Date_out is updated to the current date, the record must be
deleted
● The room that was assigned to the old patient, in the corresponding record
in the ROOM table, Status is updated to set Status=’Empty’.
○ The cleaner who was assigned to clean the old patient’s room must no
longer be assigned to that room as it is now empty. Hence, the
corresponding record with the appropriate Cleaner_id and Room_id in
CLEANER_ROOM_ASSIGNMENT is deleted.
○ However, it is important that all the former patients are audited in a table
called PATIENT_LOG. This table has the columns,
Patient_id,Patient_name,Date_in,Date_out.
○ So when the record in PATIENT table is updated to set Date_out=’today’
and the record is deleted, the old patient’s Patient_id,Patient_name,Date_in
and Date_out are inserted into the PATIENT_LOG table.


(Note: the records referencing the deleted patient record in PATIENT, in the tables
NURSE_PATIENT_ASSIGNMENT, BILL,LOCAL_GUARDIAN
PATIENT_MEDICATION_REQUIREMENTS) are deleted automatically when
the parent patient record is deleted due to appropriate referential integrity constraints

TRIGGER 3 ( trigger_3.sql )

● The MEDICINE table contains a record for a medicine only when a patient
in the nursing home needs it to be treated.
● The DISEASE table contains a record for a disease only when a patient in
the nursing home suffers from it.
● The TREATMENTS table contains a record for a medicine and disease only
when a patient in the nursing home needs that medicine to cure some
disease.
● If a patient no longer requires a medicine, the corresponding record in
PATIENT_MEDICATION_REQUIREMENTS is deleted.
● When a record in the PATIENT_MEDICATION_REQUIREMENTS is
deleted, this trigger is executed and the following occurs:
* If no other patients in the
PATIENT_MEDICATION_REQUIREMENTS table have Medicine_id =
OLD.Medicine_id, ie the Medicine_id of the deleted record, then the
corresponding record of the appropriate Medicine_id in the MEDICINE
table is deleted and the corresponding record with the appropriate
Medicine_id in the TREATMENTS table is deleted.
* If there are no other patients suffering from the disease, the corresponding
record in the DISEASE table is deleted.
